I feel like this was easily the most confident I've ever been while working on a project. I felt like no matter what problem came up I was able to handle it with little to no stress. Well... except for trying to find a soccer API and then realizing all the ones that came with the functionality I needed were upwards of $100/month(crazy right??). BUT I digress, this project was so much fun to work on because I felt I knew what I was doing the whole time! 

# PROJECT
I took the same general idea from my last project and formatted it to fit on a rails framework. Users can create their own Volta(Five-a-side) team using a set database of players, they can look at teams made by other players as well to get ideas. This time, however, I added a Teams model so I was able to show which players play for a certain professional team. Remembering my AR associations was a HUGE help for this because I was able to get associations to stretch all the way from my users model to my teams model! At first I didn't even think that was going to be possible, I thought I was going to have to go several layers deep in my associations BUT I was  able to just call User.teams and boom I had it.


This was way simpler and more fun than the sinatra project(sorry sinatra). Rails is so much easier to use, I definitely would like to work with it more once I'm settled at a company!
