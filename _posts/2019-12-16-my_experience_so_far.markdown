   I have to say, stepping into this program was unbelievably scary for me. I didn't know when, or even if, I was going to go back to school after I dropped out of college.  Since choosing Flatiron school, every single person I've spoken to (both faculty and students) has been: helpful, accommodating, and encouraging!  

   I'm usually prone to self-doubt, and it manifests as the little voice in my head saying: "Why are you doing this, you're just going to mess it up." I'm proud to say that since the beginning of my cohort I haven't had any issues whatsoever! Everything is thoroughly explained, I have abundant resources to help get me through my lessons, and I have a whole group of people who are going through the same process as I am! 

Long story short: Flatiron is great, I'm really happy, and I'm excited for what the future holds!
