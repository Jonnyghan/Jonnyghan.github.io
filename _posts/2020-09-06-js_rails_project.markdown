To say that this project was stressful would be a grave understatement, however, I do feel that this was the biggest learning experience out of all of them. I had to do so much outside research to get this project off the ground and I definitely feel much more confident in my abilities as a software engineer.

I really liked how much more I was able to do in terms of the design on this project. I felt like I wasn't able to do as much as I wanted to on the rails and sinatra projects, but now that I have a decent understanding of Bootstrap I can go back and fiddle with those as well!

The User story for my app is a story that I fit into right now, I've been asked to Assistant coach a Semi Professional Soccer Team in my area, since the coach is also a player that leaves tactics and formations to me. I looked around and couldn't find any good resources for formation data that didn't involve me googling specific games to see which team played which formation.

I decided that if I couldn't find what I needed, I'd make it!
