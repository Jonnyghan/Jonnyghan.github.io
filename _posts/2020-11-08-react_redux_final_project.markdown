This project was absolutely a handful. I had so much fun with it though, I definitely finished this with a very different understanding of how React/Redux works. 

I came up with my idea by looking at the website for the league that I coach in. It's **OLD** to say the least. Trying to sign players up is a huge hassle and I thought "There has to be a better way." When I read the project guidelines I immediately knew I had to work on a registration system, as I've been working on it I've come up with more and more ideas on how to fix and change things for the future. 

Initially I was confused on how to even get started, but after going back through the labs I felt confident about what I needed to do. I started with my backend, set up two classes with controllers and serializers and got that in working order.
Getting to the frontend was challenging at first, I couldn't figure out why my components weren't working together. After taking a step back and doing more research I was able to get things moving quickly!
